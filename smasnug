I been watchin' this opp on a drone
Pull up cockin' it, aim at his dome
Bust at right, I could never be wrong
I'ma fight for the love that we on
When we fuckin', I never be 'lone
And I never go the same way home
When I slide, gotta switch up the route
Can't let 'em follow the snipe to the house
I wish I could stop thuggin' for real
Leave the streets without me bein' killed
For so long, I been goin' on drills
Drinkin' that lean, pour it straight out the seal
I don't care, it's wherever we see him
Pussy boy better hide in the crib
I don't care if he out with his kid
'Cause he ain't 'posed to be outside, period
I wish I could stop blowin' my banger
I wish I could catch hold of my anger
With the gang and we high, live dangerous
Screamin', "Let's get it" and twistin' our fingers
Screamin', "Let's get it" and everybody with it
They know who get it lit in the building
They know we get it lit in the city
Pussy boy cappin', get hit in his fitted
Can't nobody say shit about Syk
That my brother, he wrong or he right
And 'bout Mac, I don't wanna hear nothin'
Even though he so goddamn ugly
Call Riko, I know that he comin'
That my Dirty Jay, Dirty my cousin
Play with me, Lil Ceejay gon' go diamond
Lil' Robert wan' chill and just get to that money
Poppin' Percs, I take three to the head
I can't focus, I keep seein' red
Have emotion I'm tryna suppress
Get in motion, I'm tryna suppress, yeah
That nigga switched out on everybody
When I get him, I did that for the 'jects, yeah
Zmac and Riko my stepbrothers
All of us brothers and all us gon' step
Get it done and we go have some fun
'Til somebody else say they want somethin'
I'm a gangsta, got pardoned by Trump
But I'm still out here bustin' my gun
Even Poof say he seen a lil' bitch
On my soul, I believe in Lil Crix
And I hate I had fell out with Wiz
You did what you did, so I did what I did
I don't lie, but I steal and I kill
I wish I could stop poppin' these pills
Hit his head and it drop on the wheel
Fresh out of juvie I got me a deal
Told my son I won't let no one kill me
'Cause I promised to take him to Disney
It's a must I keep clutchin' this semi
Show in the O, but my room in Kissimmee
I know everybody tell her I'm silly
But I hope that she see the best in me
Think she feelin' the kid like I'm Gillie
Think she feelin' the kid, like I'm yeah
I'ma snipe, anybody get touched
If it's pressure, I'm stretchin' you out
Last night we was vibin' so tough
She fuckin' with me and I'm fuckin' with her
I wish we could run off somewhere nice
On an island, you wake up my wife
Hopefully, I can stop livin' shiesty
Like we back from the dead, let's go start a new life
I wish I could stop thuggin' for real
Leave the streets without me being killed
For so long, I been goin' on drills
Drinkin' that lean, pour it straight out the seal
I wish I could stop blowin' my banger
I wish I could catch hold of my anger
With the gang and we high, live dangerous
Screaming "Let's get it" and twistin' our fingers
Screaming "Let's get it" and everybody with it
They know who get it lit in the building
They know we get it lit in the city
Pussy boy cappin', get hit in his fitted
